# Advanced API Testing Strategies

API testing isn't just about sending requests and validating responses. Advanced strategies can help you ensure comprehensive coverage and robustness in your API.

## 1. Test Automation for APIs

Automating API tests ensures consistency and efficiency. Popular tools include:
- **Postman**: Simplifies testing with a GUI interface.
- **RestAssured** (Java): Ideal for automated tests within CI/CD pipelines.
- **Pytest** (Python): Offers rich support for API test automation.

### Example: Automating Tests with Postman
1. Create a **Collection** for your API endpoints.
2. Add test scripts to validate responses. For example:
   ```javascript
   pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
       pm.response.to.have.status(200);
   });

   pm.test("Response has token", function () {
       pm.expect(pm.response.json()).to.have.property("token");
   });
