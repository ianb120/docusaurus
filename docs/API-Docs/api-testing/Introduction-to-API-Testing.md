# Introduction to API Testing

API testing is a critical process in software development that ensures your application's APIs function as expected, are reliable, and perform well under various conditions. This guide introduces you to API testing concepts and provides examples to get started.

## What is API Testing?

API testing focuses on verifying the business logic, data responses, and integrations provided by APIs. It typically involves sending requests to API endpoints and validating the responses against expected outcomes.

### Key Aspects of API Testing
1. **Validation of Response Codes**: Ensure the API returns correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
2. **Payload Verification**: Validate the structure and data of JSON or XML responses.
3. **Performance Testing**: Test API speed, latency, and scalability.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper responses for invalid inputs or edge cases.

## Example: Testing a User Authentication API

### Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/login`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
