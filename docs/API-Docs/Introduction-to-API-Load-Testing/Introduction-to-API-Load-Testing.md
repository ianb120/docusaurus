# Introduction to API Load Testing

API load testing helps determine how an API performs under expected and peak user loads. It ensures the API can handle multiple simultaneous requests without degradation.

## Why Load Test APIs?

1. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**: Detect slow responses and failures under heavy load.
2. **Scalability Assurance**: Ensure the system can scale with user demands.
3. **Reliability Testing**: Verify API stability over prolonged periods of usage.

## Key Metrics in Load Testing

1. **Throughput**: Number of requests handled per second.
2. **Response Time**: Time taken to process a single request.
3. **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests.
4. **Latency**: Delay between sending a request and receiving a response.

## Tools for Load Testing

Here are some popular tools for API load testing:

- **Apache JMeter**: A versatile load testing tool.
- **k6**: A modern performance testing tool built for developers.
- **Postman**: Includes basic load testing features via the Collection Runner.

## Example: Load Testing with k6

Install `k6`:

```bash
brew install k6   # macOS
choco install k6  # Windows
